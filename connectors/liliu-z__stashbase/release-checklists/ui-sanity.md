# Packaged UI Release Sanity

Run this short pass against release-candidate packages after source CI and the
platform packaging workflows succeed. It covers native, packaged, credentialed,
and media seams that no automated suite fakes.
It is not a second copy of the automated smoke suite.

`Jxx` labels refer to the stable product flows in
[`design-docs/journeys/README.md`](../design-docs/journeys/README.md). They show
which journey owns a residual check without duplicating the automated
coverage matrix.

Record one result per package/platform:

- Tag and commit SHA:
- CI run URL (successful for the exact commit):
- Coordinated Release workflow URL:
- Package/asset name and source:
- Platform and OS version:
- Tester and date:
- Start/end time (target: 10–15 minutes):
- Result: pass / fail / not applicable
- Evidence or issue links:
- Notes and every not-applicable reason:

For a release that changes retrieval ranking, chunking, an embedding model, or
provider integration, also record one complete `pnpm eval:semantic-retrieval`
report for each supported BYOK provider configured by the reviewer. Store the
reports with the release evidence and link them above. Reports must contain no
credentials. An `ACTIVE` failure blocks publication; a `CALIBRATION` report is
retained to establish the provider baseline and is not a passing gate.

Use a disposable folder and non-sensitive test documents. Do not paste tokens,
credentials, personal documents, or private Agent output into screenshots or
issue reports. Check an item only after observing the result; record a concise
reason when a platform cannot exercise it.

Before launching any test package, follow the
[packaged telemetry suppression instructions](../docs/usage-statistics.md#testing-packaged-builds).
Start the app with `STASHBASE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` and verify the local telemetry
preferences report `available: false` before exercising flows. Reapply the override
to each new process, including update verification; versions without the override
need telemetry disabled in their disposable configuration before first launch.
Never use production PostHog as the test event sink.

## Residual checks

- [ ] **J05** — When the retrieval-quality trigger above applies, select OpenAI
  in Settings, run `pnpm eval:semantic-retrieval --out <path>`, retain the
  complete report, then repeat with OpenRouter. While the dataset is in calibration, collect its
  declared minimum of three runs per provider; after activation, one run per
  provider is sufficient for an applicable release. Confirm each report names
  the commit evidence, dataset, provider, model, gate state, Recall@3, and MRR.
  Record a precise not-applicable reason only when the release did not cross a
  retrieval-quality trigger. A `CALIBRATION` gate state is expected until the
  baselines are complete and is not a failure; a report that names a dirty
  working tree, or a provider/model pair the dataset has no baseline for, is
  not usable evidence.

- [ ] **J01** — Install or unpack the release asset and launch it through the platform's
  normal path. Confirm one window appears and quits cleanly. On macOS, confirm
  Gatekeeper accepts the downloaded Developer ID-signed, notarized app without
  a security override; preserve the automated `codesign`, `spctl`, and stapler
  results with the release evidence.
- [ ] **J01** — On each platform, start from the previous published version N,
  point it at the ordinary stable release channel, and update to this candidate
  N+1. Leave a harmless edit open, click **Update** once, and confirm download,
  save-barrier handling, installation, automatic relaunch, the N+1 version, and
  exactly one running instance. Exercise macOS from the installed DMG app,
  Windows from NSIS, and Linux from AppImage; also exercise deb when it is a
  supported distribution path and record the expected administrator prompt.
  A unit-test updater double or a release-asset inventory is not evidence for
  this item. Record the observed N and N+1 versions plus the installed asset
  name; do not call the update path verified until every supported platform has
  a real result.
- [ ] **J02** — Use the real native folder picker: cancel once without changing the
  project registry, then add a disposable folder and confirm it opens.
- [ ] **J02 / J06** — Drag a real OS file or folder onto each supported drop target and confirm
  the intended import/attachment behavior and rejection feedback.
- [ ] **J01 / J03** — Exercise native menus and the platform shortcuts for Quick Open, Command
  Palette, search, Settings, window close, and quit. Confirm focus returns to a
  sensible control after dismissing an overlay, and confirm View exposes no
  Reload or Force Reload bypass.
- [ ] **J06** — With tester-owned credentials and an installed supported CLI, send one
  harmless Agent turn. Confirm streaming/activity, one permission or stop
  interaction when available, completion, and a clean close. Never use a real
  user workspace or capture credentials in evidence.
- [ ] **J05 / J07 / J10** — In a disposable project with one non-sensitive source and
  one Markdown Canvas, confirm searching by meaning returns the source, ask the
  real Agent to use that evidence and write an accepted result into the Canvas,
  approve the write, review and edit the file, then close and reopen it. Confirm
  keyword search can find the new durable content. This is a packaged integration
  check, not the semantic-quality threshold owned by the J05 Eval.
- **J11 is retired:** chat starts in an open project; no conversation migration.
- [ ] **J06** — Paste one non-sensitive clipboard image into the Agent composer. Confirm
  the attachment preview appears and accompanying text remains.
- [ ] **J09** — Open **Report a Bug…** from the native Help menu. Review the bounded
  screenshot/log previews, exclude one available artifact, prepare the report,
  and use Download. Confirm only the selected files appear in one new Downloads
  folder and nothing is submitted automatically. When browser access is safe,
  also confirm **Open GitHub** opens the prefilled issue without placing logs or
  local paths in the URL.
- [ ] **J04** — With a fresh component cache, prepare a PDF and image from the
  installed release. Confirm the live release component downloads without a
  confirmation, waiting preparation resumes, and macOS accepts the independently
  signed/notarized executable. Interrupt an initial download and confirm it
  shows the contextual Retry download action in preparation or search, or waits
  for one attempt on the next launch. Restart offline after installation and prepare
  another fixture using the same cache. Local HTTP fixture transport is not evidence for this check.
- [ ] **J03 / J04** — Open representative real PDF, DOCX, image, and audio fixtures in the
  packaged app on platforms where those formats ship. The automated journey
  uses synthetic/minimal fixtures; here confirm production rendering and, for
  audio, that play/pause and seeking produce sound and preserve control state.
- [ ] **J01 / J02 / J03** — Open a second window, switch folders, close both windows, relaunch, and
  confirm no orphan process/port, duplicate unexpected window, or lost save.

If a check fails, keep the candidate unpublished or stop the rollout, attach
sanitized evidence, and file the smallest reproducible issue. Re-run the failed
item and any adjacent native boundary after a replacement package is built.
