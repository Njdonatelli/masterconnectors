/**
 * The Gallery index: ready-made Wikis a reader can copy into a project folder.
 *
 * The whole service contract is one published JSON document, fetched through
 * the daemon's proxy because the renderer's CSP pins `connect-src` to `'self'`.
 * Two rules shape this schema.
 *
 * Fields are additive-only, so every object strips rather than refuses: an
 * index published by a newer gallery must still read here. `schemaVersion`
 * is the one gate on that, and it is a literal rather than a minimum — a shape
 * this build does not understand has to fail the parse whole, because the
 * fallback is the bundled snapshot and a half-read shop is worse than a
 * slightly stale one.
 *
 * An entry is refused rather than dropped when its own required fields are
 * missing. One unusable entry means the publication is wrong, and quietly
 * showing the rest would hide that from everyone including the publisher.
