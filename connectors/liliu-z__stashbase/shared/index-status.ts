/** The `GET /api/index-status` response contract.
 *
 *  This is the folder-scoped status the sidebar, search banner, and preview
 *  banners poll. It is a superset of the indexer's own status
 *  (`IndexerStatus` in `server/indexer.ts`): the route re-derives the path
 *  lists as folder-relative visible paths and folds in embedding
 *  availability, conversion scheduling, and preparation failures.
 *
 *  Lives in `shared/` because both processes speak it: `buildIndexStatus`
 *  in `server/index-status.ts` produces it, and the renderer consumes it
 *  through `@/common/api`. Types only — no runtime, no Node imports.
