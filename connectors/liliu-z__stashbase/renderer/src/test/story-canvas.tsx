/** The environment a story is designed to be read in, so that the two places
 *  that mount stories mount the same one.
 *
 *  Storybook's preview decorator and the accessibility test that scores every
 *  story both need the provider stack, the theme on `<html>`, and the bounded
 *  canvas the story was composed against. When each built its own, the test's
 *  claim to be scoring "the story anyone sees" was a comment rather than a
 *  fact — a story could pass the test under a stack the canvas never uses.
 *  Both import this.
 *
 *  The canvas is a `<main>` on purpose: a story is the whole of its page while
 *  it is on screen, and content outside a landmark is a real finding, so the
 *  frame gives the story one instead of the score having to look away. A story
 *  that composes a whole page skeleton brings its own landmarks and says so
 *  (`parameters.ownsLandmarks`), because a `<main>` nested inside another one
 *  is itself a finding. */
