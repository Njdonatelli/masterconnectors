/** Live layout measurement of one element, in pixels.
 *
 *  Every collapse in this project animates to a measured pixel value rather
 *  than `height: "auto"` / `width: "auto"`: framer resolves an "auto" target
 *  from the element's *visual* (transformed) size, so under a scaled ancestor
 *  the region springs out to scale × its real size and snaps back when the
 *  final "auto" lands. `offsetHeight`, `scrollHeight`, `offsetWidth` and
 *  ResizeObserver are all transform-immune, so what comes back here is the
 *  layout value whatever the ancestors do to it.
 *
 *  Height and width are the same machinery, so they are the same hook read on
 *  two axes rather than two observers written twice — the collapsing tab label
 *  in the subtle strip had its own copy, which is the sort of copy that
 *  quietly stops disconnecting. */

   * `'clipping-parent'` reads the parent's `scrollHeight` instead, so inner
   * margins count (the clipping parent's `overflow: hidden` makes it a block
   * formatting context, so they cannot collapse out) and the value stays
   * correct while the parent's own height is mid-animation. Observing the
   * child either way keeps the ResizeObserver out of a feedback loop with
   * that animation.
