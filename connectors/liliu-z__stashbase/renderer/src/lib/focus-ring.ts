/**
 * The one focus indicator recipe.
 *
 * `--focus-ring` is declared in globals.css, so the literal fallback is not
 * needed to render — it is here so a primitive copied out of this project
 * still draws a ring in a project that has not defined the token yet. That
 * fallback is the single documented exception to the "no raw hex outside the
 * token layer" rule.
 *
 * It is written once. The four spellings below used to inline the hex into
 * four separate arbitrary values, which is four places for the exception to
 * drift and four places for a typo to hide behind a ring that still draws.
 * Instead one utility declares `--focus-ring-fallback` on the element that
 * draws the indicator, and every spelling reaches the colour through
 * `var(--focus-ring, var(--focus-ring-fallback))`. Custom properties inherit,
 * which is how the `::after` seam reads it too. `lib/tokens.test.ts` holds the
 * literal equal to globals.css's `--focus-ring`.
 *
 * The class names themselves are still written out in full, because Tailwind
 * scans source for whole class names — one assembled by concatenation is never
 * generated. What is shared here is the colour, not the spelling.
