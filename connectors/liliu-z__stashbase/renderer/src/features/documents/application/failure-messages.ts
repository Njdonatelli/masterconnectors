/**
 * One reader-facing sentence per documents failure family.
 *
 * Views ask a family for the sentence a `kind` deserves instead of carrying
 * their own English. A refusal's own message never reaches the reader — a
 * transport sentence is a diagnostic, not a recovery — so the kind alone
 * selects the line, and an unrecognised rejection falls through to the family's
 * `unavailable` one. Every map covers its whole ladder, so adding a kind fails
 * the build here rather than silently showing the wrong recovery.
