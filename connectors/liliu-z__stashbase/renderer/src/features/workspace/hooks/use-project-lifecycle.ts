/**
 * Reconciliation between native folder membership and the mounted workspace.
 *
 * Both recovery paths — a folder the host says was removed, and a scope this
 * window lost — share one reconciliation lane: starting either abandons the
 * other, and every step after an await asks whether its own signal is still
 * the live one before writing anything. Unmounting aborts the lane.
 *
 * Telling the host which folder this window is on can itself fail, and a
 * window whose host disagrees about its folder can no longer reconcile
 * anything. That refusal is reported rather than swallowed.
