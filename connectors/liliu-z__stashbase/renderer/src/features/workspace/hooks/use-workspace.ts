 * The workspace runtime for the folder the project says is active.
 *
 * A runtime is built per folder and per generation and never outlives either,
 * so nothing can act on a folder the reader has already left. The session is
 * both an input and an output: it decides when a folder may be opened at all
 * (nothing is restored before the saved session has loaded) and it records the
 * runtime's state back as it changes, which is why the two are one call rather
 * than a runtime plus a persistence hook a caller could forget.
