 * The shop, and the entry page it opens inside itself.

 * An overlay rather than a route: the window keeps the folder it was showing,
 * and closing puts the reader back exactly where they were. Copying uses the
 * shared project-entry flow, which decides whether to reuse or open a window.
 *
 * The entry page replaces the shelf rather than stacking a second modal over
 * it: one dismiss target for one decision, and one way home, which the page
 * draws on its own action row so this header reads the same over the shelf
 * and over a page.
