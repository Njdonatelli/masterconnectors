 * A byte count as a reader should see it.

 * attachment and a JSON document each carried their own version — so a
 * 500-byte file could read as `512 B` on one surface and `1 KB` on another.
 *
 * Binary units throughout, because these are file sizes on disk and every
 * other size the operating system shows the reader is binary. Precision falls
 * away as the number grows: one decimal is worth reading at `1.5 KB` and noise
 * at `340.2 KB`.
