/**
 * The menu surface — everything a list of selectable rows needs that is not a
 * row and not a primitive.
 *
 * Three surfaces in this kit are the same surface: the inline Dropdown panel,
 * the Dropdown popup, and the Select popup. Each portals through a different
 * Base UI primitive and holds a different kind of row, but all three draw the
 * same three absolutely positioned overlays (the row under the pointer, the
 * selected row, the keyboard-focused row), keep those overlays in step with
 * `useProximityHover` through the same pointer and focus wiring, and open and
 * close on the same spring. That shared half lives here once:
 *
 *   - `MenuSurfaceOverlays` — the three overlays and their motion tiers;
 *   - `useMenuSurface` — proximity measurement plus focus-ring bookkeeping,
 *     returning the DOM props the surface element spreads;
 *   - `popupMotion` — the open/close transition of a portalled popup.
 *
 * Nothing here renders a row or names a primitive. Rows come from MenuItem
 * and SelectItem, which register themselves with the proximity hook this
 * module hands back.
