 * The context every menu surface shares with its rows.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in the dropdown module so that (a) MenuItem stays
 * primitive-free and self-contained, and (b) surfaces built on different
 * primitives (Radix, Base UI) can render side by side — each provides this
 * same context object, so MenuItem resolves whichever provider actually wraps
 * it.
 *
 * Neither the row's position nor the surface's checked row is passed in. Rows
 * register their element with the shared DOM-order registry on this context
 * (`lib/use-dom-order-registry`), which answers both questions from where the
 * rows actually sit — so a list that inserts a row in the middle renumbers
 * nothing, and a surface never has to be told which row it just checked.
