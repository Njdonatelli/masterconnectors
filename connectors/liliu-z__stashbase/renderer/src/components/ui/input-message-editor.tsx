/** What the user types into: the slot a consumer fills with its own field.
 *
 *  The composer used to ship a built-in textarea beside this — auto-resizing,
 *  with a ghost-placeholder overlay, history recall and a suggestion listbox
 *  reading its caret. Nothing in the product ever rendered it; the one
 *  consumer supplies a rich mention editor, and a second field the kit
 *  maintained but nobody mounted is a second set of keyboard behaviours to
 *  keep correct against no evidence. So the slot is the field, and this module
 *  owns the one thing the composer still decides about it: the step
 *  typography, handed over as pixels so the consumer's text lands exactly
 *  where the composer's chrome expects it.
 *
 *  Keyboard behaviour belongs to the field. The composer contributes only
 *  `submit`, which is what Enter does. */
