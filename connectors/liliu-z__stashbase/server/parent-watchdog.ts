/**
 * Self-termination for an Electron-owned server whose parent died without
 * completing its kill ladder (crash, force quit, OS shutdown, SIGKILL).
 *
 * Electron's `will-quit` ladder (loopback shutdown → SIGTERM → SIGKILL) only
 * exists while Electron itself is alive. When the owner dies uncleanly the
 * server — and its Python MFS daemon child holding the store lease — would
 * otherwise run until the next launch reclaims the port. POSIX reparents an
 * orphan (its ppid changes to init/launchd or a subreaper), so a ppid change
 * is a reliable "my owner is gone" signal that needs no foreign-pid polling.
 *
 * POSIX-only, matching the orphan reapers in `stale-lock.ts`; on Windows the
 * watchdog never starts and the returned stopper is a no-op.
