# sarifcheck.sh — W1-SARIF (board Track A P0-7): --lint --sarif serializes lint findings as SARIF
# 2.1.0 (github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec), the shape github/codeql-action/upload-sarif consumes for
# the code-scanning UI. Pure re-serialization of the SAME findings --lint's native XML already
# computes — no new analysis, so this gate is a PARITY + SHAPE gate, not a new-findings gate.
#
# Arms:
#   1. --lint --sarif exists and exits 0 on a real corpus
#   2. output parses as JSON (python3 json.load)
#   3. the SARIF-minimum-viable fields for GitHub code scanning are present: version, $schema,
#      runs[0].tool.driver.name, runs[0].tool.driver.rules, runs[0].results
#   4. PARITY — results count == the SAME run's native --lint findings="N" count (serialization
#      must not drop or invent findings)
#   5. deterministic — two runs byte-identical (the same contract every other lint verb carries)
#   6. relative URIs — every result's artifactLocation.uri is relative to the scanned root (no
#      leading '/', no drive letter, no '..' escape)
#   7. a known fixture (test/lintfix/bad.cpp's typedef-over-using at line 9) produces the expected
#      ruleId at the expected line
#   8. SELECTION crosses over. The XML path drops a --lint-select=/--lint-ignore= deselected rule's row
#      entirely and states selected="K of N" + the raw select= on its root; the SARIF path emitted the
#      full 39-rule catalogue BYTE-IDENTICAL whether a rule was selected in or out, and said nothing at
#      the run level. A consumer reading that document could not tell a filtered run from an unfiltered
#      one. SARIF's own field for "in the catalogue but not enabled this run" is
#      defaultConfiguration.enabled — present-and-false on a deselected rule, ABSENT (SARIF's own
#      default of true) on a kept one — and the run-level mirror rides properties beside findingsCapped.
#   9. INERTNESS crosses over. A rule row's applicable="0" in the XML means NONE of its registered
#      languages exist in this corpus, so its count="0" is structural, never a measurement. In SARIF
#      those rules read as ran-and-found-nothing. properties.applicable carries the same fact, and it is
#      emitted for EVERY rule (true as well as false) so its absence can never be read as "true".
#  10. MUTATION CONTROL for 8+9 — the unfiltered run over a C-family corpus must show the negative of
#      both: no rule disabled, and the C-family rules applicable. Without it, a serializer that hard-coded
#      enabled:false / applicable:false everywhere would pass arms 8 and 9.
#  11. THE FILESYSTEM ROOT (U) — arm 6 above proves no URI starts with '/' for the roots a gate can hand a
#      BINARY, and `/` is not one of them: a corpus at the filesystem root means crawling the whole machine,
#      so no end-to-end arm can ever reach it. The defect lives in a pure function, so the arm is a unit
#      driver over that function instead — the recipe extentcheck.sh (U) and jsonwalkcheck.sh already use,
#      compiled with the exact flags CMake gave $BIN. It pins BOTH halves of the contract together: the
#      predicate the document's envelope claims (testmap.h runsAreRootRelative, TRUE for any single
#      non-empty root, "/" included) and the URI the relativizer actually returns. A root of "/" IS its own
#      separator, so the general prefix+'/' shape could not match it and an absolute path shipped inside a
#      document declaring its rows root-relative. Regression rows for every non-root prefix are in the same
#      table, so a fix that over-strips fails here rather than on a consumer's machine.

# ── reading CMake's generated flags.make WITHOUT executing it (CWE-78) ───────────────────────────────
# `flags.make` is a GENERATED file: its contents follow from CMakeLists.txt and the compile flags, which a
# pull request may edit. This gate runs on CI through pargates.py against the runner's own build tree, so
# `eval` on a value out of that file executes whatever a PR can persuade CMake to write into a compile
# flag — on the runner. Measured on a scratch flags.make before this fix: a CXX_FLAGS line carrying
# $(touch <sentinel>) created the sentinel AND left no trace in the parsed argument list, so the execution
# was invisible as well as real. Arm 12 below pins that it cannot happen again, with the eval as its own
# positive control.
#
# `read -ra` is NOT the fix: it splits on IFS, so -I"/path with spaces/inc" becomes three arguments, and
# real CXX_INCLUDES carry exactly that shape. shlex.split implements POSIX word-splitting-with-quotes and
# EXECUTES NOTHING — $( … ) and ` … ` come back as literal argument text. Seven gates in this suite already
# shell out to python3, so this is the suite's existing dependency rather than a new one.
#
# NUL-terminated per word, because a path may contain a newline and this must not be the place that
# silently drops one; read -r -d '' rather than `mapfile -d` because macOS ships bash 3.2.
#
# THE EXIT STATUS IS PART OF THE CONTRACT — second review of #219, the same finding CodeRabbit raised on
# #227's test/lib/cxxflags.sh. shlex.split REFUSES an unbalanced quote rather than guessing, and a refusal
# that reaches the caller as an empty word list is indistinguishable from a file that had no flags. The
# first version of this fix read the words through `< <( cmakeFlagWords … )`, and a process substitution's
# status is not reachable in $? at ALL: after the loop $? is `read`'s, the redirection's status is
# discarded, and bash 3.2 sets no $! for it to be waited on. Measured on `CXX_FLAGS = -O2 -I"/unbalanced`:
#
#     producer alone            rc=1, 0 bytes of stdout, ValueError: No closing quotation
#     through < <( … )          caller $? = 0, array length 0
#
# So the callers use a plain redirection into a scratch FILE, where $? really is this function's, and
# refuse loudly on non-zero. Command substitution cannot replace it: a shell variable cannot hold NUL, and
# NUL is what keeps a path containing a newline intact.
#
# Both failure classes exit with their own code and one line of their own on stderr, rather than a raw
# traceback on a stream the gate discards.

#
# EVERY ARRAY EXPANSION IN THIS FILE IS WRITTEN `${ARR[@]+"${ARR[@]}"}`, AS A POPULATION RULE. Under
# `set -u` bash 3.2 treats an empty array's `"${ARR[@]}"` as an unbound variable and ABORTS the script —
# verified on 3.2.57: `E=(); printf '%s\n' "${E[@]}"` reports `E[@]: unbound variable`, while the guarded
# form prints nothing and continues. `${#ARR[@]}` is safe and is left alone.
#
# Third review of #219 found this at ONE site (arm 12d) and the same defect was at six more, because the
# first pass guarded the three loader assignments it was looking at rather than every array the loader can
# leave empty. Two of the seven mattered more than the named one: the arm-12 payload arrays, where an
# abort would skip the 12c/12d rows that prove the injection is gone, and the arm-11 compile line, where
# `${DIAG_LINK[@]}` is empty whenever diagnostics.cpp.o is absent — a live abort on any build tree without
# that object, independent of any parser refusal. So the rule is the file's, not the three lines'.

# This arm is the one that says the read cannot become a shell. It is a difference test, not an absence
# test: the same payload is run through BOTH parses, and the eval is required to fire. An arm that only
# checked our parse would pass just as well against a payload that never worked.

# this arm put all three on one CXX_FLAGS line and its own control went red: `NAME=( … ;touch … )` is a
# bash SYNTAX error, so the eval aborted before running the $( ) ahead of it and executed nothing. Sharing
# a line makes the shapes mask each other, so each gets its own key and its own control, and the honest
# reading of the third shape is recorded below rather than asserted away.
