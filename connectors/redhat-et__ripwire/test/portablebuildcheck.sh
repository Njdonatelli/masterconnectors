# portablebuildcheck.sh — gate for L1 ( independence MUST-FIX #5): "Non-NATIVE build hardcodes
# -mcpu=apple-m1 -ffast-math — Linux/x86 fails out of the box".
#
# Exercises the REAL arch-flag-selection logic in cmake/PortableFlags.cmake — not a reimplementation —
# by include()-ing it into a tiny standalone CMakeLists.txt in a scratch dir. This is deliberately NOT a
# full `cmake -S . -B ...` configure of the real project: that would pay for all 15 FetchContent grammar
# clones just to inspect three compiler flags. PortableFlags.cmake only touches APPLE/CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
# and the two options, so a `project(x LANGUAGES NONE)` host is enough to drive it for real.
#
# Checks:
#   1) default (no flags) configure on THIS machine: if this machine really is Apple Silicon, the auto
#      -mcpu=apple-m1 branch must fire (proves auto-detect still gives Apple-Silicon devs today's behavior).
#   2) default configure + RIPWIRE_PRETEND_LINUX=ON (the test-only hook): must emit -O2 -ffast-math
#      -fno-finite-math-only and NOTHING Apple/host-specific (-mcpu=apple-m1 absent, -march=native absent).
#      This is the provable half of "Linux/x86-64/aarch64 must configure cleanly with no Apple flags" —
#      see the NOTE at the bottom for what this machine cannot prove.
#   3) RIPWIRE_NATIVE=ON: must emit -march=native (opt-in, unaffected by RIPWIRE_PRETEND_LINUX).
#   4) the real top-level CMakeLists.txt no longer hardcodes -mcpu=apple-m1 unconditionally (it must be
#      confined to the RIPWIRE_IS_APPLE_SILICON branch inside cmake/PortableFlags.cmake).
#   5) the real top-level CMakeLists.txt still routes through cmake/PortableFlags.cmake (didn't drift back
#      to an inline literal).
#   6) no ordered STL algorithm over std::string_view takes the default comparator in src/ — a line-local grep
#      (#6), a pass that resolves each container through its declaration (#6b), and a pass that resolves each
#      explicit LAMBDA comparator's parameter and member types (#6c, the shape #343/#344/#345 landed with),
#      each with planted controls.
#
# Usage: test/portablebuildcheck.sh
# Exits non-zero on any failure; prints PASS/FAIL per check, ALL PASS on success.

# compile `-mcpu=apple-m1` and no -march at all. Clang >= 17 (AppleClang 16 — the Xcode 16.2 release.yml
# pinned from c7982037 through 0.6.1) rejects that outright: "unsupported option '-mcpu=' for target". Clang 16 (AppleClang

# ── #2h retired with the release leg it held ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# #2h pinned release.yml's macos-x64 leg to the runner, Xcode and deployment target it was verified on, because that
# leg ran its x86-64-v3 binary under Rosetta 2. The leg left the matrix after 0.6.1, so there is no tuple to hold;
# test/releaseinstallcheck.sh (H7) now refuses a macOS x64 leg in release.yml, and re-adding one restores this arm
# from history (`git log -S relverdict -- test/portablebuildcheck.sh`) together with fresh evidence for its tuple.

# ── #2i: the macos-arm64 release leg ships the toolchain CI tests, at a pinned minimum macOS ───────────────────────────
# Three facts, held in step, text-level on any host:
#   * The leg's runner and Xcode are the exact pair its release was verified on, and ci.yml's macOS legs (the eight gate
#     shards and the sanitizer leg) run that same pair — TESTED == SHIPPED. Xcode 26.6 (17F113, Apple clang 21.0.0) is
#     there because ASSUME_NO_ALIAS's `__builtin_assume_separate_storage` reaches the loop vectorizer only from LLVM 18
#     (llvm/llvm-project#64666, fixed by #76770): Xcode 16.2's AppleClang 16, which built this leg through 0.6.1, is
#     LLVM 17 and keeps every runtime overlap check (test/noaliascheck.sh arm 6, LOOP_NOT_CONSUMED). A text check cannot
#     read a compiler version, so the pair is held exactly and moved deliberately, with noaliascheck's classification on
#     the new pair as the evidence. A half-done move is the other failure: an `ASAN_OPTIONS` or `DEVELOPER_DIR` condition
#     in ci.yml still naming the old runner silently turns leak detection on, or hands a leg the image's default Xcode.
#   * The minimum macOS is PINNED, a decision rather than a side effect of the runner. With no deployment target clang
#     takes the lower of the runner's macOS and the SDK default, which was 14.0 on macos-14 (otool on v0.6.1's
#     ripwire-0.6.1-macos-arm64: `minos 14.0`, `sdk 15.2`) and is 26.x on macos-26, so the runner move alone would have
#     dropped every macOS 14 and 15 user. 14.0 is also the std::print floor (src/infra/emit.h) and README's "Prebuilt
#     macOS floor"; quoted, because a bare 14.0 is a YAML number, not the string the otool minos check matches. ci.yml's
#     macOS legs build at the same target, since libc++ decides what it declares available by the deployment target.
#   * The pin reaches the binary and is read back off it: a step exports matrix.deployment_target as
#     MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET before the first configure, and an otool minos step runs on build/ripwire after the PGO
#     binary is staged there and before Package tars it. The pin has ONE source: no -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET,
#     -mmacosx-version-min or second MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET anywhere in the leg or the build job's env and steps (a
#     `--cmake-extra -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=15.0` on the pgobuild step would win over the export).
#   * Nothing fails silently. Every step that carries the pin runs on every macOS leg (`if:` absent or
#     `runner.os == 'macOS'`, never `matrix.deployment_target`, which skips a leg that lost the key), and each guard
#     that turns a lost pin into a red is present: the export's empty-target refusal, the exact string compare of
#     otool's minos, the toolchain record step (empty DEVELOPER_DIR, clang++ and llvm-profdata inside it) ahead of the
#     first build, and ci.yml's two CMakeCache.txt checks (the gate shards' front-end step, the asan macOS configure).
# Three mutated copies prove the verdict can fail, each by exactly its own row: release.yml without the minos step,
# release.yml whose pgobuild step overrides the target with -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=15.0, and ci.yml whose sanitizer
# leg's ASAN_OPTIONS condition still names macos-14.

# `n1 - n2` on size_type and lets it wrap (bits/string_view.h, _S_compare). That wrap is well-defined C++,
# but the G1 sanitizer stack runs -fsanitize=integer, which reports it, and -fno-sanitize-recover=all turns
# the report into an abort. libc++ (every macOS leg, including the macOS ASan leg) computes the same answer
# without the subtraction and never reports. So `std::binary_search( first, last, sv )` is green on this
# machine, green on the macOS sanitizer leg, and aborts EVERY ranked run on the Linux sanitizer leg.
# That is exactly what happened at 69a17f9: the external-name veto's two table lookups took main red with
# `unsigned integer overflow: 3 - 17` inside std::binary_search, on a repository whose own macOS battery
# and macOS ASan leg were both clean. The rule is therefore mechanical: pass an explicit byte-comparator.

# ── #6b: the same rule, resolved through each container's DECLARATION — the half the grep above cannot see ──
# #6 is line-local and type-blind: it fires only when `string_view` is spelled on the call line, and it never
# looked at std::sort at all. PR #135's extent detector sorted a std::vector<std::string_view> MEMBER declared
# 67 lines up and binary-searched a std::span<const std::string_view> PARAMETER (src/extentsuspect.h); neither
# call line names the type. #6 stayed green, both macOS legs stayed green, and on the Linux G1 leg every ingest
# of a C++ tree with two same-file class names that prefix one another aborted INSIDE ingest — before any verb
# ran, so even --pack-task's refusal arms died rc=134 with empty stderr (CI run 34583440115; the report,
# `unsigned integer overflow: 8 - 13` at libstdc++ string_view:576, came from resetExtentScratch's std::sort).
# The pass: every ordered algorithm called at its DEFAULT arity (no comparator argument) → the container its first
# argument ranges over (`x.begin()`, `std::begin( x )`, a ranges:: argument) → the NEAREST PRECEDING declaration
# of that name in the same file (a member access skips parameter-shaped ones). string_view anywhere in that
# declaration's template arguments (vector, span, array, a pair element) or a C array of string_view is a finding.
# static_assert calls are exempt: constant evaluation runs no sanitizer. A ranges call at the ambiguous
# iterator arity whose LAST argument is comparator-shaped (a lambda, a bare or qualified name) is the
# (range, comp) overload and is skipped here — a safe `ranges::sort( v, svLess )` must not be accused as
# a default-comparator call; #6c owns the lambda form. Disclosed floor: a BARE output-iterator name at
# that arity reads as a comparator, so a TWO_RANGE iterator form ending in a bare `out` escapes the
# default-comparator check. Stated blind spots — zero findings means
# "none found", not "none exists": a container declared in ANOTHER file, an `auto`-typed container, and a
# comparator lambda that itself applies `<` to string_views. The two control scans run on planted input every
# time, so a scanner that goes quiet fails this arm instead of passing it.

# ── #6c: no LAMBDA COMPARATOR of an ordered STL algorithm orders string_view operands with operator< ──
# #6 and #6b both stop at the call's SHAPE: #6 excludes every call that passes a comparator at all, and
# #6b resolves only the CONTAINER of default-comparator calls. A lambda that is explicit but itself says
# `return a < b;` over string_view operands walks through both arms straight into libstdc++'s
# string_view::_S_compare — the `n1 - n2` wrap G1 aborts on. The top-level <string_view> header carrying
# _S_compare is NOT in CMakeLists' libstdc++ ignorelist (that covers bits/basic_string.h and
# bits/string_view.tcc), which is how #343 (pathInIgnoreSet), #344 (situ's lexical-sibling index) and
# #345 (finalizeNamedIdents) landed green on main while the Linux G1 self-run and --situ aborted.
# This pass resolves the lambda's operand types two ways: DECLARED string_view parameters (by value, by
# const reference, by pointer), and struct members declared std::string_view (the struct map is built
# brace-balanced from every file under the scanned root, so a brace-initialized field counts and a
# member defined in model.h resolves at its use in renamemine.h). A named comparator variable
# (`const auto byPath = []( … ){ … };` passed to five sorts) resolves through its definition. Safe calls
# (svLess, nameLess, memcmp) are blanked per CALL, not per lambda — a MIXED comparator that routes one
# key through svLess and orders another with raw operator< is still a finding — and every relational
# operator is judged inside its own ternary branch/statement, so a numeric tie-break beside svLess calls
# (finalizeNamedIdents' shape) is not. `std::ranges::sort( range, comp )` — ambiguous with (first, last)
# by arity alone — is classified by its last argument's shape, so #6b's default-comparator pass never
# accuses a safe `ranges::sort( v, svLess )` and this pass owns the lambda form.
# FLOOR, disclosed: `const auto&` parameters, std::pair .first/.second members, locals aliasing a
# container element (`const Symbol& x = ing.symbols[a];`), and a PROJECTION lambda of a
# (range, comp, projection) call — scanned only as a comparator candidate, never resolved as a
# projection — are NOT resolved; the clean control pins the auto-parameter floor so it cannot widen
# silently. Hand-rolled memcmp comparators (ingest.h's extLess) are clean by contract:
# memcmp-then-length never subtracts.

# NOTE (what this gate can prove vs what only Linux CI can prove): this machine is Apple-Silicon macOS, so
# it can prove the FLAG-SELECTION LOGIC never emits an Apple-specific flag once RIPWIRE_IS_APPLE_SILICON is
# false (checks #2/#3 above, via the RIPWIRE_PRETEND_LINUX hook), and that the real CMakeLists.txt wires
# that logic in (checks #4/#5). It CANNOT prove that clang/gcc on actual Linux/x86-64 hardware accepts the
# resulting flags and links a working binary, nor exercise CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR values this host never
# reports (e.g. "x86_64"). That end-to-end proof is exactly what .github/workflows/ci.yml's ubuntu-24.04
# matrix leg provides; this gate is the local, sub-second proxy that catches a regression before it ever
